class TodoList:
    """
    A class to manage a todo list.

    The todo items in the todo list are dictionaries, each containing an id, a description, and a completed status.

    Example:
    {
        "id": 1,
        "description": "Buy groceries",
        "completed": False
    }


    The id is a unique identifier for the todo task that also tells at which index in the list the task is located.
    The todo list is 1-indexed, meaning the first task has an id of 1, the second has an id of 2, and so on.
    Thus, the index of a task in the list is its id minus 1.

    Managing the index and ids works similarly to managing a serial id in a database.
    Creating a new task increments the id counter by 1 (the id counter is equivalent to the list length),
    and deleting a task does not change the ids of other tasks or their position in the list.
